Turn your Wordpress site to a powerful online community and see your business grow.

== Description ==

mooWP plugin acts as a bridge between mooSocial platform and Wordpress to turn your WordPress Site Into a Social Network. It allows you to turn your one-time visitors into loyal, long-term users by providing them a place to sign up, connect with each other, post messages, and more

*Why choose mooSocial to add Social network for WordPress*

Why would you want to send your existing users on your Wordpress site to other social networks like fb, twitter ... .to increase the traffic for them instead of building a community for them to keep coming back to get quality traffic to your website.

mooSocial is a "white labeled" php social network software.It is light, fast, easy to customize, and mobile-friendly.  Adding mooSocial into your existing Wordpress site using mooWP will provide all the needed social features to keep your users engaged with your platform. This is crucial for growing an active community that you can leverage for social marketing, greater exposure and increased revenue.

Zero headache to deal with 3rd party developers and compatible issues between developers because everything is from mooSocial Team. We have all of the plugins and apps that you need to have to build a successful community. The existing community plugins for Wordpress may be FREE and cheaper but most of them lack a lot of features/plugins for a social platform.  Whenever you need a new plugin or modify the existing social feature, you have to go with 3rd party solutions but normally they don’t talk to each other. This developer may break something else from other developers and vice versa…..

Quick support: we provide the best customer support through many support channels like ticket, skype, community and online chat. For each client, we have dedicated technical support staff to handle any questions from them to help you create a successful community. Please read our review here

== Use of a 3rd Party ==

mooWP plugin is free but to run it requires you to purchase a license of the social network platform mooSocial . This plugin is only responsible for connecting WordPress site and mooSocial platform to synchronize users and notifications system.

How it works: When you buy a license, we will provide free installation service and installation package. If you are technically savvy, you can install it yourself based on the instructions [here](https://moosocial.com/knowledge-base/moowp-installation-and-configuration/ )

After installing and configuring correctly according to the instructions, mooSocial and WordPress site will be connected to each other. Sign up/in will be performed on the WordPress site and users will be automatically created on the community site. If there are notifications in the community, you will see them on your WordPress site through the notification system included in the mooWP plugin. We will help change the color of the community site to make it similar to your existing WordPress site to give your users the feeling that they are using a single platform.

We provide 2 options for you to choose from when installing.

* Use our cloud hosting and pay monthly/yearly. Can subscribe the cloud service here
* Install directly on your server and pay ONE-TIME fee license. Can purchase the life-time license [here](https://moosocial.com/knowledge-base/moowp-installation-and-configuration/ )
